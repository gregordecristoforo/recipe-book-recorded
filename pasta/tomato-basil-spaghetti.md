# tomato basil spaghetti

## Ingredients

- Spaghetti (enough for your serving size)
- 2-3 ripe tomatoes, diced
- Fresh basil leaves, torn or chopped
- Olive oil (2-3 tablespoons)
- Salt and pepper (to taste)
- Optional: Garlic (1 clove, minced) and grated Parmesan cheese


## Instructions

- Cook Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside, reserving some pasta water.
- Prepare Tomatoes: In a bowl, combine diced tomatoes, torn basil leaves, and minced garlic (if using). Drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Let it sit for a few minutes to allow flavors to meld.
- Combine: Toss the cooked spaghetti with the tomato mixture. If the pasta seems dry, add a little of the reserved pasta water to help coat the spaghetti.
- Serve: Plate the spaghetti and top with additional fresh basil and optional grated Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.
